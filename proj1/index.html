			<h2> Shapes and Ladders</h2>
			<h4> Inspiration</h4>
			<img src="eg1.PNG"width="10vw">
			<p> On reading Programming Design Systems, I was inspired by the way that basic shapes could convey meaning though just their composition.</p> <p><strong> I plan to use digital tools for this project.
	
			</strong>  I have been experimenting with versions in Photoshop but would like to use p5.js to fix the shapes in relation to the canvas as it is displayed on a webpage.
			Digital tools make it easy to experiment with variation and repitition of shapes, as well as creating clean shapes. </p><p>

			<h4> Phase 1</h4>
			<div> <img src="c1.png"></div>
			<p>I have just experimented at first with the objects and arrangements. Using only black and white shapes and outlines.</p><p>To have a consistent theme, I chose a series of shapes expressing movement- how can movement be expressed with still images of shapes?</p>
