		<h1>Processing community day!</h1>
				<p> I was checked in in time to have breakfast before the opening remarks. 
					Unfortunately I missed the workshops but found the lectures interesting. 
					My first lecture was Narratives of Resistance and Resilience, a project based on the Hong Kong protests. 
					The analysis of consuming articles as she could not be present and comparing the police propaganda to counter propoganda was interesting, however what fascinated me the most was the element of audience participation which grew beyond what the creator expected. 
					Instead of choosing from words provided to complete the phrase, “The Hong Kong Police___”, people took the magnet words and rearranged them to form their own.
