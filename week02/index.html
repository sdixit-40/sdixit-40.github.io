      <h3>Baldessari inspired work</h3>
    
    <div>  <p>This work is based on Baldessari's combination of text and images-both wrong and Goya series.</p>
      <p>As Baldessai was deconstructing photographic techniques, I decided to try the same for one of the basic principle of animation- Stretch and Squash. 
        Using the bouncing ball exercise with a coin, I stretched and squashed it in the opposite places to where thy should be.
